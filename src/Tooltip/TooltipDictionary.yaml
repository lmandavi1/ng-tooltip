    Once you add a Barrier here in **Flow Control**, you reference it in the **Barrier** steps you add to the stages of your Pipeline.
Verify_stepName_StepConfig: |-
    The **Verify** step in a CD stage uses Harness Continuous Verification (CV) to verify your deployments.

    Harness CV integrates with your APMs and logging tools to:

    - Verify that the deployed service is running safely and perform automatic rollbacks.
    - Apply machine learning to every deployment to identify and flag anomalies in future deployments.

    [Learn More](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/3xhqq9xllp)
cvData_name: Enter a name for this step.
cvData_timeout: |-
    Enter a timeout for this step. 

    You can use:

    - `d`  for days
    - `h`  for hours
    - `m`  for minutes
    - `s`  for seconds
    - `ms`  for milliseconds

    The maximum is `53w`.

    Timeouts can be set at the Pipeline level also.
cvData_spec.type: |-
    Select a type that matches your deployment strategy.

    **Rolling**, **Canary**, and **Blue Green** refer to the strategy of the stage.

    For example, Canary deployment strategies use the **Canary** Continuous Verification type, and so on.

    Typically, **Load Test** is used in lower environments like QA where there is no continuous load and the deployments are usually verified by generating load via scripts, etc.

    [Learn More](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/3xhqq9xllp)
cvData_spec.monitoredServiceRef: |-
    Click **Click to autocreate a monitored service**.

    Harness automatically creates a Monitored Service using a concatenation of the Service and Environment names. 

    For example, a Service named `todolist` and an Environment named `dev` will result in a Monitored Service named `todolist\_dev`.

    If the stage Service or Environment settings are [Runtime Inputs](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/f6yobn7iq0), the Monitored Service and Health Sources settings will show up in the Runtime Input settings when you run the Pipeline.

    [Learn More](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/3xhqq9xllp)
cvData_spec.spec.sensitivity: |-
    Select the risk level that will be used as failure criteria during the deployment. 

    When the criteria are met, the **Failure Strategy** for the stage or step is executed.

    For time-series analysis (APM), the risk level is determined using standard deviations, as follows: `5𝞼` (sigma) represents high risk, `4𝞼` represents medium risk, and `3𝞼` or below represents low risk.

    Harness also takes into account the number of points that deviated: 50%+ is **High**, 25%-50% is **Medium**, and 25% or below is **Low**.

    [Learn More](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/3xhqq9xllp)
cvData_spec.spec.duration: |-
    Select the number of data points Harness uses. If you enter **10 min**, Harness will take the first 10 minutes worth of the log/APM data points and analyze it. [Learn More](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/3xhqq9xllp)

    The length of time it takes Harness to analyze the 10 min of data points depends on the number of instances being analyzed and the monitoring tool. If you have a 1000 instances, it can take some time to analyze the first 10 minutes of all of their logs/APM data points.

    The recommended **Duration** is 10 minutes for logging providers and 15 minutes for APM and infrastructure providers.

    Harness waits 2-3 minutes to allow enough time for the data to be sent to the verification provider before it analyzes the data. This wait time is a standard with monitoring tools. So, if you set the Duration to 10 minutes, the 10 minutes excludes the initial 2-3 minute wait, but the total sample time is 13 minutes.
cvData_spec.spec.trafficsplit: ""
cvData_spec.spec.deploymentTag: |-

delegateSetupStepForm_k8sConfigDetails.namespace: |
    By default, the Delegate resides in a namespace in the target cluster with a service account attached to it. The service account uses a ClusterRole for permission to deploy to all namespaces in the cluster.

    This centralized model is simple and efficient, but it doesn't let you restrict teams to deploying into specific namespaces. Any team member can deploy to any namespace.

    As an alternative, you can use a distributed model that places a Delegate in a specific namespace in the cluster. It limits each Delegate to deploying into its own namespace only. 

    Later, when you set up a Harness Kubernetes Cluster Connector to the cluster, you can use a service account in that namespace with the Cluster Admin role. [Learn More](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/jud4rz7wl4)

    AutoStopping Rules make sure that your non-production resources run only when used, and never when idle:
    - Automatically detect idle times and shut down (on-demand) or terminate (spot) resources.
    - Automatically restart resources whenever there is traffic or usage requests.
    - Stopped/terminated machines are always accessible using the same access patterns that the team is used to – DNS link, SSH, RDP, background tasks.
    - Enable running workloads on fully-orchestrated spot instances without worrying about spot interruptions.

    To configure AutoStopping Rules, you first need to create a connector to connect Harness to your account and then create AutoStopping Rules.


    Connectors allow Harness to connect to your deployment environments, such as Kubernetes Clusters, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc. For more information, see the following topics:
    - [Create an AWS Connector for AutoStopping Rules](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/hiyi6xvj36)
    - [Create an Azure Connector for AutoStopping Rules](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/e7yidxmtmj)

        A Terraform plan is a sensitive file that could be misused to alter resources if someone has access to it. Harness avoids this issue by never passing the Terraform plan file as plain text.

        Select a [Secrets Manager](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/hngrlb7rd6) to use for encrypting/decrypting and saving the Terraform plan file. [Learn More](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/52n3j0ci72)

        There are different ways to connect to your target infrastructure: 

        #### Direct Connection 
        A vendor-agnostic connection to the cluster that uses a Harness [Kubernetes Cluster Connector](https://ngdocs.harness.io/article/1gaud2efd4). The Connector uses the cluster master URL and an auth method such as a Kubernetes service account or it inherits credentials from a Harness Delegate running in your infrastructure.

        #### Cloud Provider
        A connection to the cloud platform where your cluster is hosted, such as GKE on GCP. It uses a platform [Cloud Connector](https://ngdocs.harness.io/category/1ehb4tcksy) to connect to the cluster. The Connector uses platform-specific auth such as a GCP service account (with Kubernetes Engine Admin and Storage Object Viewer roles) or it inherits credentials from a Harness Delegate running in your infrastructure.
